# IUMDE
Intelligent User Manager Developer Environment

This is the first attempt at starting on a long journey. I've noticed a big divide between users, and developers of software. I would like to bridge that gap.

There are many IDE's out there, but so far I haven't found an IUMDE. I'll approach this challenge from the User perspective, because I have only a small mind, that's not capable of churning out code. I love working on concepts, and have seen a few applications that might give clues to the road ahead!

That's it for now!

To be continued...

Have a nice day!
